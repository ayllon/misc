[  ] Package installs properly.

[  ] The source package does not include license text(s) as a separate file from upstream.
[  ] No PreReq
[  ] %makeinstall is not used
[  ] Timestamp is preserved
[  ] Parallel make
[  ] Subpackages other than devel should require the base package using a fully versioned dependency.
